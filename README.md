**Description:** For this project we had the task of modelling the shipment problem described in `specification.pdf`. We had to model import and export constreaints as well as other costs associated with travelling to find out the size of the fleet of two different types of boths that the fictious government of the proposed problem would have to acquire. The problem was solved using Simplex.

The `report.pdf` contains a detailed description of both the problem and our efforts at modelling and solving it. We also had the task of answering to some proposed questions that made us analyse our results and do sensitivity analisis to avoid solving the problem again to answer these questions.

**Technologies:** Excel

**Skills:** Operations Research, Linear Programming, Simplex, Linear problem modelling, Transportation Problems, sensitivy analysis.

**Grade:** 17.9/20
